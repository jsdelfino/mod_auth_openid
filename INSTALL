Basic Installation
==================

First, you'll need a few prerequisites.
 - libopkele from http://kin.klever.net/libopkele/
	It's a C++ implementation of important OpenID functions.
 - libdb_cxx from http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/db
	Berkeley DB C++ libs (now owned by Oracle)

Next, run:
$> ./configure
or 
$> ./configure --help
to see additional options that can be specified.

Next, run:
$> make

Do NOT run "make install".  You should use Apache 2's apxs program to install 
the mod_auth_openid module.  Do this by running:
$> /path/to/root/apache2/bin/apxs -i -a -n 'authopenid' libmodauthopenid.la

You will probably have to be root.


Usage
==================

In either a Directory, Location, or File directive in httpd.conf, place the following directive:

AuthOpenIDEnabled        On

There are also two additional, optional directives:

AuthOpenIDDBLocation     /some/location/my_file.db
AuthOpenIDTrusted        http://myopenid.com http://someprovider.com 

AuthOpenIDDBLocation: This is an optional directive. It specifies the place the BDB file should 
be stored; it defaults to /tmp/mod_auth_openid.db.

AuthOpenIDTrusted: This is an optional directive. If specified, only users using the providers 
listed will be allowed to authenticate. There should be no trailing slashes.

The user's identity URL will be available in the REMOTE_USER cgi environment variable after 
authentication.
